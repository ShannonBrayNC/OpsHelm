# OpsHelm — Technical Requirements

## 1. Purpose

OpsHelm is an **Email-Native Operations Console** designed to convert Outlook email, ticket notifications, and calendar events into actionable operational intelligence.

The system ingests email via Microsoft Graph and produces:

- A daily execution plan (“Today’s Runway”)
- Customer queue daily briefs (one-click, branded)
- Meeting preparation briefs
- Promise/commitment tracking with reminders and receipts
- Quarterly and yearly accomplishment summaries (review-ready)

OpsHelm must support **Whiteglove partner delivery**, where identity, branding, and ticket sources are isolated by workspace.

---

## 2. Core Design Principles

- **Email is the system of record**
- **Evidence first** (every summary links to source receipts)
- **No silent automation** (drafts only, explicit approval required)
- **Workspace isolation** (no cross-customer or cross-partner leakage)
- **Contracts over vibes** (AI codegen must respect function contracts)

---

## 3. Definitions

### 3.1 Workspace

A **Workspace** is a hard operational boundary that governs:

- Mailbox identity and folders (e.g., Parex vs ParkPlace)
- Ticket source patterns (ConnectWise vs ServiceNow via email)
- Branding identity (From name, signature, disclaimers)
- Allowed customer themes
- Data isolation (partition key: `workspaceId`)
- Output voice and export headers

**Acceptance Criteria**
- No entity may be created, queried, or exported without a `workspaceId`
- UI must clearly indicate the active workspace (guardrail banner)

---

### 3.2 Theme (Customer Branding)

A **Theme** defines customer-specific branding:

- Logo (SVG/PNG)
- Color palette (primary, secondary, accent, background, card, text)
- Label aliases (e.g., *Ticket #* vs *Case*, *Priority* vs *Severity*)
- Export footer and disclaimer blocks
- Optional email tone/voice template

**Acceptance Criteria**
- All exports (HTML, Markdown, PDF, DOCX) use Workspace identity + Theme
- Theme availability is filtered by workspace

---

### 3.3 Ticket Sources

A **TicketSource** is a configurable email extraction profile.

Required support:
- **ConnectWise** numeric tickets (e.g., `#162518`)
- **ServiceNow** identifiers:
  - `INC#######`
  - `REQ#######`
  - `RITM#######`
  - `CHG#######`
  - `TASK#######`

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Ticket ID detection is configuration-driven, not hard-coded
- Multiple ticket sources may coexist per workspace

---

## 4. Core Data Entities (POC)

  - Post-meeting recap template

---

### 4.6 Artifact and Impact

**Artifact**
- Type (Script, Report, Brief, Runbook, Dashboard, Other)
- Title and creation date
- Delivery targets
- Related tickets
- Link or file reference

**Impact**
- Estimated hours saved
- Risk reduced or outcome achieved

---

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Ingestion (Microsoft Graph)

The system must ingest:

- Mail:
  - Inbox
  - Workspace-approved folders
  - Sent Items (for promises and accomplishments)
- Calendar events (for meeting prep)

Processing requirements:
- Classify all messages
- Extract ticket IDs using workspace ticket sources
- Extract asks and promises with due dates
- Maintain processing coverage metrics
- Route low-confidence items to an Exceptions queue

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Inbox Coverage Meter shows processed vs unprocessed
- No message is silently dropped

---

### 5.2 Today’s Runway (Daily Execution Plan)

- One-click generation of today’s prioritized tasks
- Derived from:
  - Ticket asks and promises
  - Stale tickets
  - Upcoming meetings
  - Overdue commitments
- Each item includes evidence links

**Acceptance Criteria**
- “Generate Runway” produces actionable items with receipts

---

### 5.3 Ticket Triage Board

Buckets:
- New
- Waiting on Customer
- Waiting on Me
- In Progress
- Risk

Ticket cards display:
- Ticket ID, customer, queue
- Priority/severity
